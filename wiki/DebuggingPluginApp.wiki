#How to debug and test the application

= Debugging The Plugin Application =
In following ways the application can be debugged:
  * We have a log file, we can use that to log and displayed detailed information on our point of interest: variables, objects and flow.
  * We can generate Message Dialog Box for displaying small info. However, we need to be very careful if we use MessageBox for debugging. Because MessageBox is created in a loop that will create lots of problem while WMP is running with the plugin activated. So, if you use MessageBox be certain that this will not be executed more than a few times.
