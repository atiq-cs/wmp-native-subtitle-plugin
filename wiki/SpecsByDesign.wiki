== Unix Conventions ==
We are supporting Unix Text File encoding which uses \n instead of \r\n. However, our output file use \r\n and utf-8 encoding.

== Counter Number ==
=== Max length ===
Max length of counter number / sequence including trailing spaces can be MAX_SEQ_LENGTH which is currently defined as 8. So,
a number such as this 123456789 will go into caption text rather than being considered as number.
